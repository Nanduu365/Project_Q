# Project_Q


### Dividing the project to multiple parts

First a working sample of each should be created so that it works with a sample input like a string

1. The main LLM
2. input to braille conversion
3. braille to input conversion
4. text to audio conversion
5. audio to text conversion
6. text to sign language conversion
7. sign language to text conversion
8. Frontend , backend and UI
    + These can be designed using anything by the person who designs it.
    + As a suggestion, many libraries of python does this things by few lines of code - the output will be a simple one ,but may be very useful for a prototype.
    + Genral interface - the interface should be a like a chat bot, with options for multiple inputs + upload files and should alos have option to download the generated output.
